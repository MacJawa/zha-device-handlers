## Device diagnostics
<!--
  Diagnostics data is used by ZHA unit tests to make sure quirks create the expected
  entities and we do not have regressions. For all new quirks, we require device
  diagnostics.

  You can find the diagnostics information by going to the device page, clicking the
  three dots, and then by clicking on "Download diagnostics". Drag-and-drop the
  downloaded file into this section.
